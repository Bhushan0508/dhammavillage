# **CSR PARTNERSHIP**

## **Dhamma Village Initiative**

### **Preventive Mental Well-Being Infrastructure for Rural India**

*(CSR Schedule VII Compliant)*

**Partner with a long-term, low-risk, high-impact rural development
model.**

## **THE CSR PROBLEM YOU ALREADY KNOW**

-   Rising stress, addiction, and social conflict in rural communities

-   CSR programs often fund **events**, not **systems\
    **

-   Short-term interventions show weak long-term outcomes

-   Mental health spending is mostly reactive and urban-centric

**CSR needs preventive, durable models---not recurring liabilities.**

## **THE DHAMMA VILLAGE SOLUTION**

**Dhamma Village** is a **permanent rural ecosystem** that integrates:

-   Preventive mental well-being

-   Ethical and disciplined daily living

-   Community participation

-   Rural self-sustenance

It is **not a retreat**, **not a religious institution**, and **not a
charity camp**.\
It is **infrastructure for inner stability and social cohesion**.

## **WHY THIS QUALIFIES FOR CSR SUPPORT**

✔ Aligned with **Schedule VII, Companies Act 2013\
** ✔ Non-religious, non-political, non-commercial\
✔ Focus on mental well-being, rural development, and education\

✔ Designed for CSR exit after stabilization

**This is capital creation, not consumption.**

### **2. Low Operating Risk**

Minimal staff, low overheads, no revenue pressure.

### **3. Permanent Asset**

Replicable across districts without redesign.

# **HARD ADVICE (DO NOT IGNORE)**
