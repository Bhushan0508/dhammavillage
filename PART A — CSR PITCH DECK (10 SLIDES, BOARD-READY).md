# **PART A --- CSR PITCH DECK (10 SLIDES, BOARD-READY)**

Use this exactly as slide content. Do **not** add fluff visuals.

## **Slide 1 --- Title**

**Dhamma Village Initiative\
** A Preventive Mental Health & Ethical Living Model for Rural India

Implemented by: \[Trust / Section 8 Name\]\
CSR Alignment: Schedule VII, Companies Act 2013

## **Slide 2 --- The Problem**

-   Rising mental stress, addiction, and social conflict in rural
    communities

-   No sustained access to mental well-being tools

-   Short-term interventions fail to create behavioral change

**Reality:** Government systems treat symptoms, not causes.

## **Slide 3 --- The Gap**

-   Meditation retreats are temporary

-   Hospitals are reactive

-   NGOs run events, not ecosystems

**Missing:** A permanent, low-cost, preventive mental health
environment.

## **Slide 4 --- The Solution**

**Dhamma Village\
** A permanent rural settlement where:

-   Meditation is practiced daily

-   Ethical living is cultivated

-   Work and spiritual growth coexist

This is **not** a retreat, not a religious institution, not a charity
camp.

## **Slide 5 --- What Makes This Work**

-   Proven Vipassana methodology

-   Minimal infrastructure, low operating cost
