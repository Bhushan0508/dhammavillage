### **Dhamma Village -- Vision Note**

Dhamma Village is a rural community development initiative designed to
address long-term mental well-being and social cohesion through
preventive, non-clinical means. The project integrates disciplined
living, ethical conduct, and community responsibility into everyday
rural life rather than treating mental well-being as a short-term or
institutional intervention.

The initiative operates on the principle that stable behavior and social
harmony emerge from structured environments and consistent routines, not
from one-time programs or reactive systems. Dhamma Village therefore
creates a permanent living ecosystem where individuals continue their
normal livelihoods while participating in daily mental discipline
practices, shared responsibilities, and community-based activities.

The model is non-religious, non-political, and non-commercial. It is
inclusive and accessible, particularly for rural and underprivileged
populations who lack sustained access to mental well-being resources.
Infrastructure is intentionally simple and low-cost, emphasizing
self-sufficiency through agriculture, sustainable energy, and collective
living.

Dhamma Village is implemented by a Public Charitable Trust with
transparent governance and is designed for convergence with government
schemes and CSR support. The objective is not dependency on funding, but
the creation of a stable, self-operating community system that continues
after initial support.

By focusing on prevention rather than correction, Dhamma Village aims to
reduce long-term social stress, improve ethical conduct, strengthen
community bonds, and offer a replicable model for rural mental
well-being and development.
